1. Necessary coordinations between parsing and rendering - 
 - After parsing, the field in map struct -> width and height, must be initialized
   using the maximum size of the map. This means the width and the height of the
   the rectangle that is able to completely contain the whole map inside of it.
   This size will be used to create a 2D char pointer and initialize it accordingly
   which will be useful in controlling the bounds of the map and the movement of
   the player within it.
 - 


2. Gameplay elements
 - The game seg-faults when the rendering goes out of bounds. This needs to be
   checked and fixed.
 - Fix the walking and running movements delta for small angles which
   won't show for walking but does for running, by implementing fractional accumulation
 - Add the ability to hold more than one key at a time. eg. moving forward
   while turning
 - 


3. Project progress and game elements
 - Integrate and make runnable with the current parser instead of the mini-parser
 - Add rays within the field of view by using draw lines or similar
 - Add collision detection so that player does not overlap with existing blocks
 - Figuring out how to use textures and initializing them in the game struct


4. Parsing issues
 - The check_key_data_completion() fn needs to be restored after texture initialization
 - Parser needs to check for other types of spaces in map
 - Parser needs to add extra padding for tabs
 - The direction that the player is facing is not linked by the parser


5. Optimizations
 - Angle increment with turn keys are detected keeps increasing the angle of the
   current direction. This might be an issue while stress-testing. Remedy this by
   using the fmod() fn with 2*PI value.
