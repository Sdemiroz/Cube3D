# Quick Explanation Guide - Texture Issues and Fixes

## The Problems We Solved

### Problem 1: Sliding Textures üéØ
**What it looked like:** Textures appeared to slide or shift as you moved around
**Why it happened:** We were using screen position instead of world position for textures
**The fix:** Use actual wall hit coordinates for texture mapping

### Problem 2: Blocky Textures üé®  
**What it looked like:** High-res textures looked like they only had 15 colors horizontally
**Why it happened:** Ray hit coordinates were stored as integers, losing precision
**The fix:** Store coordinates as floating-point numbers

## Simple Analogy

**Think of it like taking a photo:**

**Problem 1 (Sliding):** 
- ‚ùå Like numbering photos by the camera position instead of what's in the photo
- ‚úÖ Now we number them by what we actually photographed

**Problem 2 (Blocky):**
- ‚ùå Like having a high-res camera but only saving pictures in 15 pixels wide
- ‚úÖ Now we save the full resolution

---

## Key Numbers

- **TILE_SIZE = 15:** This is why we only got 15 colors
- **Ray coordinates before:** 0, 1, 2, 3... 14 (integers)
- **Ray coordinates after:** 0.123, 4.567, 8.234... (decimals)
- **Texture resolution:** 2487x2487 pixels (now we can use all of it!)

## Show Your Peer

1. **Look at the debug output in the docs** - shows the quantized values
2. **Compare before/after visual quality** in the game
3. **Point out the data type change:** `int hit_x` ‚Üí `double hit_x`
4. **Explain the coordinate system:** screen space vs world space

---

## The "Aha!" Moment

**The breakthrough:** When we added debug prints and saw this pattern:
```
Ray[100]: hit_x=0.400000  (which is 6/15)
Ray[200]: hit_x=0.866667  (which is 13/15)  
Ray[300]: hit_x=0.466667  (which is 7/15)
```

Only 15 different values! That's when we knew the problem was integer truncation.
